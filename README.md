# Coin Change Challenge

This is my take on the famous coin change challenge.

* A car park has a payment machine that accepts only cash – notes and coins.
* It's a max stay 24-hour car park, so cars cannot stay longer than this duration or they get towed!
* It costs £3.00 for the first hour, and then 1p for every extra min stayed.
* Coins are 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and £1; Notes can be £5, £10, and £20

This program takes the time the car enters the car park and the time it exits as inputs, it calculates and outputs the parking charge and asks the user for payment. It then calculates the output change using the least amount of coins/notes.

## Test examples
```
Time in: 9:06
Time out: 10:17
Payment In: £5

Output cost: £3.11
output change: £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, 2p
```
